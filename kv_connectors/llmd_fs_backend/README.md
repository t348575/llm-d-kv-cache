> **The filesystem offloading logic is now upstreamed into vLLM** as the FS tier of the

## Overview

The llmd-fs-backend extends the native [vLLM Offloading Connector](#offloading-connector-docs) to support file system and object store backends, with the object store backend support provided by NIXL.
This backend provides a shared-storage offloading layer for vLLM. It moves KV-cache blocks between GPU and shared storage efficiently using:

- GPU block transfers using GPU DMA (default) or optional GPU-kernel-based copying using GPU SMs.
- Thread-local pinned staging buffers
- Multiple I/O worker threads
- NUMA-aware CPU scheduling of worker threads
- Atomic file writes and reads

The fs connector is suitable for shared storage, as well as a local disk.

For architectural clarity, the fs backend is not responsible for cleanup. It is up to the storage system to manage this.
For simple setups, see the **Storage Cleanup** section.

## System Requirements

- vLLM version 0.22.x. Previous vLLM lines are supported via matching wheel versions on the pip index — vLLM 0.X.x uses `llmd-fs-connector==0.X` (see [Installation](#installation)).

## Installation

### 1. Install from the pip index (Recommended)

The connector is published as a PEP 503 simple index hosted on GitHub Pages. The index points at wheel assets attached to GitHub Releases — `pip` auto-selects amd64 vs arm64 from your platform.

CUDA 12 (default):

```bash
pip install 'llmd-fs-connector==0.22' \
  --extra-index-url https://llm-d.github.io/llm-d-kv-cache/simple/
```

CUDA 13:

```bash
pip install 'llmd-fs-connector==0.22' \
  --extra-index-url https://llm-d.github.io/llm-d-kv-cache/simple/cu130/
```

For an older vLLM release, match the pin to your vLLM line — vLLM 0.X.x uses `==0.X` (e.g. vLLM 0.18.x):

```bash
pip install 'llmd-fs-connector==0.18' \
  --extra-index-url https://llm-d.github.io/llm-d-kv-cache/simple/
```

Or download a wheel manually from the release assets at <https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-kv-cache/releases>.

A complete list of available releases is published at <https://llm-d.ai/llm-d-kv-cache/simple/llmd-fs-connector/>.

### 2. Build from source (compile yourself)

Requires CUDA toolkit and system dependencies. 

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libnuma-dev git cuda-toolkit-12-9
pip install --no-build-isolation git+https://github.com/llm-d-kv-cache.git#subdirectory=kv_connectors/llmd_fs_backend
```

### 3. Developer mode (clone and editable install)

Clone the source and install in editable mode:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libnuma-dev git cuda-toolkit-12-9
git clone https://github.com/llm-d-kv-cache.git
cd llm-d-kv-cache/kv_connectors/llmd_fs_backend
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

Alternatively, you can build and push a development container image directly using the provided `Dockerfile.dev`. This image includes all dependencies and performs an editable installation:

```bash
# Build from the root of the repository
make image-fs-backend-build IMAGE_TAG_BASE=<your-base-container-registry> FS_BACKEND_NAME=<image-name> DEV_VERSION=<dev-version>

# Push the development image
make image-fs-backend-push IMAGE_TAG_BASE=<your-base-container-registry> FS_BACKEND_NAME=<image-name> DEV_VERSION=<dev-version>
```

## Configuration Flags

### Connector parameters

- `shared_storage_path`: base path for storing and loading the KV data files.
- `block_size`: number of tokens stored per file (must be in granulaity of GPU block size).
- `threads_per_gpu`: number of I/O threads per GPU
- `max_staging_memory_gb`: total staging memory limit
- `max_write_queued_seconds`: maximum time budget (in seconds) for queued writes before excess writes are dropped (default: `30.0`, set to `0` to disable). The actual write queue depth limit is computed dynamically as `threads_per_gpu * max_write_queued_seconds / avg_write_duration`. For example, with 64 threads and `max_write_queued_seconds=30`: on fast NVMe storage (20ms avg write) the limit is ~96,000 (effectively unlimited), while on slow block storage (2s avg write) the limit is ~960. Dropped writes result in cache misses on future reads, not data loss.
- `gds_mode`: GPUDirect Storage mode (default: `disabled`). See [GPUDirect Storage (GDS)](./docs/gds.md) for options, requirements, and verification.
- `backend`: POSIX, OBJ (default: `POSIX`)

### Environment variables
- `STORAGE_LOG_LEVEL`: set the log level for both C++ and Python (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Default: `info`
- `STORAGE_CONNECTOR_DEBUG`: legacy flag — setting to `1` enables debug-level logging (equivalent to `STORAGE_LOG_LEVEL=debug`)
- `USE_KERNEL_COPY_WRITE` : enable GPU-kernel-based writes using GPU SMs (default 0 - uses DMA copy).
- `USE_KERNEL_COPY_READ`: enable GPU-kernel-based reads using GPU SMs (default 0 - uses DMA copy).
- `USE_BATCH_MEMCPY_WRITE`: submit all per-(block, layer) copies in one `cudaMemcpyBatchAsync` call on writes (default 1, requires CUDA 12.8+; set to 0 to fall back to the per-call DMA loop).
- `USE_BATCH_MEMCPY_READ`: same as above for reads (default 1).

## Example vLLM YAML

To load the fs backend:

```yaml
--kv-transfer-config '{
  "kv_connector": "OffloadingConnector",
  "kv_role": "kv_both",
  "kv_connector_extra_config": {
    "spec_name": "SharedStorageOffloadingSpec",
    "spec_module_path": "llmd_fs_backend.spec",
    "shared_storage_path": "/mnt/files-storage/kv-cache/",
    "block_size": 256,
    "threads_per_gpu": "64"
  }
}'
--distributed_executor_backend "mp"
```

It is recommended to use multiprocess mode by setting:
`--distributed_executor_backend "mp"`

To configure environment variables:

```yaml
env:
- name: STORAGE_LOG_LEVEL
  value: "debug"
```

### K8s Deployment Example

A full K8s deployment example can be found in the [`docs`](./docs/deployment) folder.

Before applying the YAML, create the HF token secret:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<HF_TOKEN>
kubectl create secret generic hf-token --from-literal=HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN"
```

This example also creates the required PVCs (using CephFS):

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./docs/deployment/pvc.yaml
```

Then apply the full vLLM deployment (including the offloading connector with a file system backend installation inside the pod):

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./docs/deployment/vllm-storage.yaml
```

## On-disk Layout

KV blocks are organized under `shared_storage_path` by a config fingerprint, so runs with identical config share the same folder and reuse the same cache:

```
<shared_storage_path>/<safe_model_name>_<sha256-12hex>/
    config.json                                       # shared across ranks
<shared_storage_path>/<safe_model_name>_<sha256-12hex>_r<rank>/
    <hhh>/<hh>_g<group>/<block-hash>.bin              # per-rank KV blocks
```

The hash fingerprints every field that affects the on-disk format (model, parallel sizes, dtype, block sizes, kv_cache_groups, inference_engine). `rank` lives outside the hash: the base folder (with `config.json`) is shared across ranks, while each rank's KV blocks land in a sibling `_r<rank>` folder.

`config.json` is written by the first init and records the fields, for example:

```json
{
  "dtype": "torch.bfloat16",
  "hash_block_size": 16,
  "gpu_blocks_per_file": 256,
  "inference_engine": "vllm",
  "kv_cache_groups": [
    {
      "block_size": 16,
      "layer_names": ["model.layers.0.self_attn.attn", "..."]
    }
  ],
  "model_name": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B",
  "dcp_size": 1, "pcp_size": 1, "pp_size": 1, "tp_size": 1
}
```
## Metrics

The fs backend populates vLLM's built-in offloading metrics. When Prometheus metrics are enabled in vLLM, the following metrics are automatically exported:

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `vllm:kv_offload_total_bytes` | Counter | Total bytes transferred, labeled by `transfer_type` |
| `vllm:kv_offload_total_time` | Counter | Total time spent on transfers (seconds), labeled by `transfer_type` |
| `vllm:kv_offload_size` | Histogram | Distribution of transfer sizes in bytes, labeled by `transfer_type` |

The `transfer_type` label distinguishes transfer directions:
- `GPU_to_SHARED_STORAGE` — GPU to storage (PUT)
- `SHARED_STORAGE_to_GPU` — storage to GPU (GET)

These metrics are also available through vLLM's internal StatLogger.

For a complete monitoring setup (Prometheus, Grafana, port-forwarding, and benchmarking), see the [Monitoring Guide](./docs/monitoring.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Missing `numa.h`
Install the required package:

```bash
apt-get install -y libnuma-dev
```
